# BitProject

A lightweight and efficient BitTorrent client built from scratch, designed for seamless peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing. This project focuses on implementing core torrenting protocols, optimized data transfer, and a user-friendly interface for managing downloads. Perfect for exploring distributed file-sharing technology and learning about network protocols.

## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer File Sharing**: Efficiently share and download files across a distributed network.
- **Torrent Protocol Implementation**: Core functionalities such as chunk downloading, seeding, and leeching.
- **Magnet Link Support**: Add torrents using magnet links for ease of use.
- **Optimized Data Transfer**: Designed to ensure efficient bandwidth utilization.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for managing torrents.
- **Hash Verification**: Ensures data integrity by verifying downloaded chunks.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: JavaScript
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Bencode [More to be added as the Project Grows]
- **Protocols**: Torrent protocol, peer-to-peer networking
